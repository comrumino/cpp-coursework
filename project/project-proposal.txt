# Project Proposal:
 + demonstrate as many of the principles of object-oriented design as possible in your project
 + Your grade will be based on style, the thoroughness of your design, the correctness of your implementation, and the completeness of your testing.


Project Proposal:
    Preventing license theft and improving transparency licensing model for client is fundamental to any business. Implementing a licensing model
which interacts with the C-API has a larger scope than is possible to finish within three weeks. So, the aim for this project is implement the core
features necessary for minimal functionality while still being extensible. Given the risk of scope creeping, it is important to be precise.

Initial requirements:
 + Basic integrity control, if not rudimentary, define a methodology to be used in the creation of a network which mitigates risks and ensures mutual integrity
 + License verification, define a class to verify a given input is a valid license which also interacts with integrity controls
 + License generation, define a function which takes transient data and returns a verifiable license
Reach requirement:
 + Create a C interface for licensing and integrity controls for python and go
