1. In the "Introduction Forum" Tell a bit about yourself:
What is your experience with programming? What programming courses have you taken?
    I've programmed mostly in Python in industry (three years), with a little course work in data structures and computer systems.
What programming languages do you already know, and how well do you know them?
    Python, Shell, and JavaScript are my primary interpreted languages. I have less than a year experience with typed languages.
What is your current occupation, and does it require you to program?
    My current title is Application Security Quality Engineer and I program daily at work.
What are your other hobbies and interests?
    Cooking, recipes other than the ones on the box, is a hobby of mine. Other interests of mine include snowboarding and frisbee golfing.

2. Write a program that prompts the user to enter an int, a double, and a string on the command line.
Read the values into variables of the appropriate data type with std::cin. 
Write the 3 values to std::cout.
This program does not require the use of CppUnitLite.


3. Write CppUnitLite tests which verifies std::stringstream.
These test will follow the pattern shown in the lesson 1 discussion Use stringstream instead of atoi and sprintf. Write separate tests to:
+ read and write a double
+ read and write a float
+ read and write a string
Initialize a stringstream with the "Hello". Attempt to stream this value into an int variable. Write a check that verifies this fails.
Be sure to use CHECK_DOUBLES_EQUAL for float types and CHECK_EQUAL for other types.


4. Write a CppUnitLite test that uses new to allocate an array of 10 integers.
Initialize the array with the values 0 to 9. Use CHECK_EQUAL to verify the array has the correct values. Use delete to deallocate the array.


5. Write a CppUnitLite test that creates a std::vector of int. Add 10 integers to the vector with the values 0-9. 
Use CHECK_EQUAL to verify the vector has the correct values.
